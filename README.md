# 📜 Description
In this project, we use a dataset of home prices and their features to train a linear regression model. The primary goal is to predict the price of a house given its features such as area, number of bedrooms, etc.

# 🚀 Getting Started
Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

# 📋 Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:

* Python 3.6 or higher
* Jupyter Notebook
* Necessary Python libraries (listed in requirements.txt)
# 🔧 Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```plaintext
git clone https://github.com/akash247777/Linear-Regression.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```plaintext
cd Linear-Regression/Linear\ Regression/Home\ Price\ Prediction
```
3.Install the required libraries:
```plaintext
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
# 📊 Running the Notebook
```plaintext
To run the Jupyter Notebook, use the following command:
```
# 📈 Results
Once you run the notebook, you will see the predicted home prices along with visualizations showing the performance of the linear regression model.
